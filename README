A simple connection pool implemented in Golang.

It maintains two pools internally. The base pool will not shrink in size, 
   and the expanded pool will shrink if connections are not used for some time.
   This is useful when the backend (e.g. MySQL server) kills inactive connections.

This implementation can be easily generalized into a resource pool. The necessary
changes should be obvious when reading the code.
